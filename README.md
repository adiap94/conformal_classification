# Reliability in Machine Learning - Conformal Classification

## Background
This work is based on [Uncertainty Sets for Image Classifiers using Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14193) written by Angelopoulos, Anastasios N and Bates, Stephen and Malik, Jitendra and Jordan, Michael.

## Setup
1. In order to run the code, you first need to download the dataset and set the envoirnment by following the [original source code](https://github.com/aangelopoulos/conformal_classification/) 
2. Run main_wrapper.py in order to run both RAPS AND QRAPS
