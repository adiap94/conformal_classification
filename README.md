# Reliability in Machine Learning - Conformal Classification

## Background
This work is based on [Uncertainty Sets for Image Classifiers using Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14193) written by Angelopoulos, Anastasios N and Bates, Stephen and Malik, Jitendra and Jordan, Michael.
In this work we propose new regularization methods called QRAPS (Quadratic Regularized Adaptive Predictive Sets) and compare it to the RAPS (Regularized Adaptive Predictive Sets) algorithm that was proposed in the original paper. 

You can read our full report [here] ([https://github.com/aangelopoulos/conformal_classification/](https://github.com/adiap94/conformal_classification/blob/main/report.pdf). 

## Setup
1. In order to run the code, you first need to download the dataset and set the envoirnment by following the [original source code](https://github.com/aangelopoulos/conformal_classification/) 
2. Run main_wrapper.py in order to run both RAPS AND QRAPS
